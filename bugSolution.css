To solve the issue, ensure you understand how specificity works and structure selectors to get the desired outcome. You may need to rewrite or restructure the selectors to achieve your intended style.  For example, you could refactor the CSS to improve clarity and ensure the intended style is applied:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green !important;
}

/* Or more precisely target the specific element */
#myDiv.container {
  color: purple;
}
```

Using `!important` should be avoided in most cases, as it can create maintenance problems, but it may be needed in certain scenarios.
The better solution is to revise selectors to reflect the specific style requirement.
