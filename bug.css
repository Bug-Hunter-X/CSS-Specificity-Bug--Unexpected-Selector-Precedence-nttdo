The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple;
}

```

In this example, if the element with the id "myDiv" is also within a container with the class "container", the color purple will be applied. This happens due to the higher specificity of the `#myDiv.container` selector. However, an uncommon bug occurs when developers misunderstand the order of precedence of selectors and expect that the `#myDiv` will override the other selectors, which is incorrect because of the specificity rules.
